--------------------

TBD:
 + SWI:  Harmonization of bdb and rocks db ? 
         Rocks allows aliases.
         Duplicate option for rocksdb.
         Rocks doesn't have mode (and does not open as read only so no 2 processes can open the db?)
         Would be nice to have the "correct" types when opening an existing database with no options.
         Rocks: Enumerate connections ? rocks_current(X).
